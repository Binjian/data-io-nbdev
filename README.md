# Overview

tspace is an data pipleline framework for deep reinforcement learning
with IO interface, processing and configuration. The current code base
depicts an automotive implementation. The main features are:

- working both training and inferrence mode
  - cascaded threading pools for scheduling of
    [ETL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load) and ML
    pipelines
  - online and offline training
  - local and distributed training
- supporting for multiple models
  - reinforcement learning models with DDPG
  - time sequence processing with recurrent models
- data pipelines compatible to both ETL and ML dataflow
  - Support for multiple data sources (local CAN or remote cloud object
    storage)
  - Stateful time sequence processing with sequential model
  - Support both NoSQL database, local and cloud data storage

The diagram shows the basic architure of tspace. The main components
are:

- **[`Avatar`](https://Binjian.github.io/tspace/00.avatar.html#avatar)**:
  orchestrates the whole ETL and ML workflow.
  - It configure RemoteCAN, Cruncher, Agent, Model, Database, Pipeline.
  - It also manages the scheduling of the workflow threads.

- **KvaserCAN** composes of
  - [`Kvaser`](https://Binjian.github.io/tspace/06.dataflow.kvaser.html#kvaser):
  - [`send_float_array`](https://Binjian.github.io/tspace/04.conn.tbox.html#send_float_array):
  - [`udp_context`](https://Binjian.github.io/tspace/04.conn.udp.html#udp_context):

- **RemoteCAN**:
  - [`Cloud`](https://Binjian.github.io/tspace/06.dataflow.cloud.html#cloud)
    select local udp with
    [`Cloud.hmi_capture_from_udp`](https://Binjian.github.io/tspace/06.dataflow.cloud.html#cloud.hmi_capture_from_udp)
    or remote hmi with `Cloud.hmi_capture_from_rmq` or none in pure
    inference mode with
    [`Cloud.hmi_capture_from_dummy`](https://Binjian.github.io/tspace/06.dataflow.cloud.html#cloud.hmi_capture_from_dummy)
  - [`RemoteCanClient`](https://Binjian.github.io/tspace/04.conn.remote_can_client.html#remotecanclient)

- ## **Cruncher**:

- **Agent**:

- **Model**:

- **Database**:

- **Pipeline**:

- **Config**:

- **Sched**

## TODO

1.  Add time sequence embedding database support with LanceDB for
    TimeGPT
2.  Batch mode for large scale inference and training with Unit of Work
    pattern

# How to use

## Install

``` sh
pip install tspace
```
